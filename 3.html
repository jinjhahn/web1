<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/javascript">JavaScript</a> is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means <strong>to add dynamic and interactive elements to <u>websites</u></strong>. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.

<p>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For exsample, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the require fields have been filled out.
  The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.
</p>
<p>Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.
